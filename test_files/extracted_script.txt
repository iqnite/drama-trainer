MURDER AT RAVEN HALL (working title)

PROLOGUE: PRE DINNER DRINKS
PEMBERTON: (rings a bell) Dinner is served.

ACT ONE
SCENE 1: THE DISCOVERY
ROSIE: Good morning, Senator Stone! Early riser today? Usually you sleep until ...
ROSIE: (deadpan) Oh. You're dead. Pemberton? Rosie. We have a problem in the library. The Senator won't have his usual breakfast ... on account of being murdered. Yes, I'm sure. There's a letter opener right in his heart. Antique bronze, yes. No, I didn't touch it! I watch CSI. Okay, I'll wait here.
PEMBERTON: My God! What a mess the Senator made. Red wine all over the place. (smells it) The best Bordeaux!
ROSIE: Look! Blood all over the antique Persian rug. That’s worth thousands!
PEMBERTON: Tens of thousands! Ambassador Wellington will be furious. I dread to think.

SCENE 2: THE MORNING AFTER
WELLINGTON: A murder. A MURDER! In MY residence! During a state visit! Do you understand what this means?
LUCY: (not looking up) International incident, career-ending scandal ... possible imprisonment!
WELLINGTON: (pointing at her) This is YOUR fault! You arranged the dinner party!
LUCY: You approved the guest list!
PEMBERTON: If I may, Ambassador, assigning blame won't resurrect the Senator.
GERRY: Should I lock down the building? I saw that in a movie once.
WELLINGTON: You should have LOCKED IT DOWN LAST NIGHT! You are head of security. How did a murderer get in?
GERRY: Well, all the windows were locked. And the doors. I was monitoring the cameras... during commercial breaks.
PEMBERTON: You were watching television. What program were you watching?
GERRY: (enthusiastically) X Factor! The Final. You know, I’m entering X Factor next year. They accepted me for an audition.
WELLINGTON: (to the ceiling) Give me strength.
GERRY: What do you suggest I sing? Sondheim? Lloyd Webber? This one from Phantom?
PEMBERTON: Gerry, stop that noise! We’re not interested. And ... The police are here.
FINCH: (peering into the audience) What interesting bird life here. Is that a parakeet I see over there? Oh, and a budgerigar! How unusual.
HARRIS: (interrupting as if this often happens, to the others) Excuse us, I’m Deputy Harriet Harris, and this is ... (indicating Finch)
FINCH: Oh! Good morning! Detective Fringuello Finch —yes, like the bird. My parents were bird lovers too.
CRADDOCK: And I’m Constable Chris Craddock. (proudly) On my first job out.
WELLINGTON: (impatient) Let’s get on. We need this resolved quietly and quickly.
FINCH: (peering through binoculars at the theatre lights) Hmm. No swallows nesting. Unusual for this time of year.
HARRIS: (wearily) Detective, the body?
FINCH: (still peering through binoculars) What?
CRADDOCK: The deceased human.
HARRIS: (touching Finch's arm gently) Detective Finch? The murder investigation?
FINCH: (lowering binoculars) Right, yes. The body.
CRADDOCK: (to Harris, quietly) Typical. Show a man something with feathers and he forgets why he's here.
HARRIS: (defensive) He's brilliant once he focuses.
CRADDOCK: If you say so....
HARRIS: We'll need to interview everyone who was here last night.
WELLINGTON: Everyone?
HARRIS: All staff, all guests. No one leaves the grounds.
GERRY: That's what I said! The lockdown thing!
CRADDOCK: And we'll need a complete guest list, staff roster, and...
FINCH: (interrupts, sniffing) Is someone baking?
LUCY: That's Chef Maggie. She starts breakfast at six.
FINCH: Early riser. Like the American Robin. Turdus migratorius. Active at dawn. Highly territorial...
WELLINGTON: Are you comparing my chef to a bird?
FINCH: I compare everyone to birds, Ambassador. It's very illuminating.
PEMBERTON: Shall I assemble the household, Detective?
FINCH: Yes, please. And you—you're clearly a Great Blue Heron. Patient. Observant. Sees everything.
PEMBERTON: (slight smile) How perceptive. And how true. I see ... and I hear everything

SCENE 3: THE KITCHEN INTERROGATION
CRADDOCK: Chef O'Donnell?
MAGGIE: (not turning) If you're here about the breakfast, tell the Ambassador to shove it up her ... (gesture) whatever. The eggs will be ready when they're ready.
HARRIS: We are here about the murder, actually.
MAGGIE: (whirling around, brandishing a wooden spoon, accidentally hitting Finch, hard) Well, I didn't do it! I was in my room all night. Alone. Completely alone.
HARRIS: Who can verify that?
MAGGIE: I'm a chef, not a social butterfly. After service, I was exhausted. I went to bed at eleven, slept like the dead.
CRADDOCK: Slept like the dead?
MAGGIE: Sorry, poor choice of words—I didn't wake until six.
FINCH: (studying her) More like a Hawk. Fierce. Efficient predator. But also surprisingly social.
MAGGIE: (suspiciously) Is that good or bad?
FINCH: Depends on whether you're the hawk or the rabbit.
CRADDOCK: (to Harris) Does he really compare everyone to birds?
HARRIS: Everyone. Last week he called the mayor a "pompous peacock."
CRADDOCK: Was he wrong?
HARRIS: (slight smile) Not even slightly.
FINCH: (overhearing) Harris, you're more of a Dove, actually. Patient, gentle, loyal...
HARRIS: (flustered, pleased) Oh. That's... thank you, Detective.
CRADDOCK: (rolling eyes) And what am I? A pigeon?
FINCH: Crow. Highly intelligent, problem-solver, a bit cheeky.
CRADDOCK: Okay, I'll take that.
HARRIS: (to Maggie) Tell us about dinner last night. What was served?
MAGGIE: Seven courses. Started with oysters, ended with a soufflé that was PERFECTION.
PEMBERTON: I served Beef Wellington for the main course.
ROSIE: Senator Stone had three helpings of dessert.
PEMBERTON: He complained about portion sizes being "European."
FINCH: How did he seem? Upset? Like a Nervous Bird?
PEMBERTON: Extraordinarily rude, the same as always.
ROSIE: He snapped his fingers at me for more wine. (demonstrating)
PEMBERTON: Argued politics with that Russian. Oh, and he talked to Lucy after dessert, in the hallway. She didn't look happy.
CRADDOCK: What time did guests go to their rooms?
MAGGIE: Around ten-thirty. The Australian Prime Minister stayed up with some whisky.
PEMBERTON: The Ambassador left straight away, complaining of indigestion.
MAGGIE: Indigestion! from my food! Preposterous.
PEMBERTON: Then the Senator went to the library. He was never seen alive again.
BLAKE: Maggie, love, any chance of coffee? Absolute killer hangover—oh. (noticing the detectives) killer (Laughs)... sorry mate.
HARRIS: Prime Minister Hutchinson. How convenient. We need to speak with you.
BLAKE: (running hand through hair) Can it wait? I'm not at my best before coffee.
MAGGIE: (already pouring) Here. Black. Strong.
BLAKE: (taking cup, smiling rakishly) You're an angel, Maggie.
MAGGIE: (flirting) Go on with you.
PEMBERTON: Rosie, we should be cleaning the dining room.
HARRIS: (observing their interaction) Prime Minister, where were you between eleven pm and six am?
BLAKE: In my guest room. Sleeping off that excellent scotch.
CRADDOCK: Alone?
BLAKE: (hesitating) Yes. Alone.
MAGGIE: (too quickly) He was definitely alone.
CRADDOCK: (eyes narrowing) How would you know that, Chef?
HARRIS: Chef O'Donnell, were you in your room alone or not?
MAGGIE: (defeated) Fine. FINE. I ... visited the Prime Minister's rooms. Around midnight. For... diplomatic relations.
BLAKE: (charmingly) Very diplomatic relations.
CRADDOCK: So you're each other's alibi.
MAGGIE: We didn't kill anyone! We were... occupied.
CRADDOCK: How long were you "occupied"?
BLAKE: (grinning) Hours. I'm very committed to international cooperation.
MAGGIE: (mortified) Do we really have to discuss this?
CRADDOCK: Yes. We need exact details.
HARRIS: Perhaps you could... describe your evening?
BLAKE: You want the play-by-play?
CRADDOCK: Yes. For verification.
MAGGIE: (burying face in hands) This is hell. This is my personal hell.

SCENE 4: FLASHBACK: THE DIPLOMATIC ALIBI
MAGGIE: (nervously) You said you wanted a snack.
BLAKE: Maggie. I didn't actually want a snack.
MAGGIE: Oh. Then why did you—
BLAKE: Because I wanted to see you. Alone.
MAGGIE: (setting down dish) That's... very sudden.
BLAKE: I'm Australian. We're direct. And you're magnificent, passionate, strong. (stepping closer)
MAGGIE: I'm a working girl. You're a dignitary. This is inappropriate.
BLAKE: You're right. Completely inappropriate. (gets closer...) But you're still here.
MAGGIE: The food—
BLAKE: Bugger the food.
MAGGIE: This is insane. I could lose my job.
BLAKE: I could cause an international incident.
MAGGIE: We should stop.
BLAKE: Absolutely.
MAGGIE: Wait, wait. If we're doing this, we're doing it properly.
BLAKE: (grinning) God, I love your confidence.
MAGGIE: And no one can know. The Ambassador would have my head.
BLAKE: Our secret.
MAGGIE: One more thing—
BLAKE: Yes?
MAGGIE: You’d better be good at this.
BLAKE: Challenge accepted.
BLAKE: (breathless) That was...
MAGGIE: (equally breathless) Yeah.
BLAKE: We should probably...
MAGGIE: Do that again?

SCENE 5: BACK TO REALITY
CRADDOCK: (after taking notes) So you were... "occupied" for nearly four hours?
BLAKE: (grinning) I'm very thorough.
CRADDOCK: Men always say that.
HARRIS: Craddock!
CRADDOCK: What? I'm just saying, in my experience—
HARRIS: (cutting her off) Don’t get personal.
FINCH: (examining Maggie and Blake) Excellent stamina. Like Wood Ducks during mating season. They can go on for hours.
HARRIS: (coughs) yes, well... That gives you both alibis for the critical window.
BLAKE: So we're cleared?
HARRIS: Unless you're lying. Or coordinated the murder before your... encounter.
MAGGIE: We didn't! We barely knew each other!
BLAKE: Well, we know each other quite well now.
MAGGIE: (elbowing him) Not helping!
FINCH: The Wood Ducks will be at it again very soon. (laughing meaningfully)
HARRIS: Detective, let's interview the others. Chef, no one leaves this kitchen.
MAGGIE: This is my domain. I give the orders.
MAGGIE: Now everyone will know about our... diplomatic relations.
BLAKE: At least we have an alibi.
MAGGIE: The Ambassador will fire me when she finds out.
BLAKE: (moving closer) Was it worth it?
MAGGIE: (trying not to smile) Diplomatically speaking?
BLAKE: Personally speaking.
MAGGIE: Out! I have breakfast to finish!
BLAKE: (exiting) To be continued, Maggie O'Donnell!
MAGGIE: (to herself, smiling despite everything) Bloody Australian.

SCENE 6: THE RUSSIAN RIDDLE
HARRIS: Mr. Volkov. We need to speak with you.
SERGEI: (in thick Russian accent) Of course, Officer. I have nothing to hide. Everything is transparent, like window. Glasnost, you know, from our most honourable Mr Gorbachev.
PENELOPE: (to her roses) One of those communists!
CRADDOCK: Where were you last night?
SERGEI: I was in my quarters. Reading Tolstoy. Very long book. War AND Peace. Such rich content.
CRADDOCK: Did anyone see you?
SERGEI: Loneliness is condition of intellectual pursuit, no? One does not read Tolstoy in crowd.
PENELOPE: (to her roses, loudly) He's lying. He was wandering the halls at one o’clock.
SERGEI: (startled) Excuse me? What you say?
PENELOPE: (still to the roses) I was bringing in my night jasmine from the terrace. I saw him near the library. Creepy.
SERGEI: (smoothly) Ah. Yes. I remember now. I was... sleepwalking.
CRADDOCK: Sleepwalking?
SERGEI: Old Russian condition. Very common. We wander in our sleep, dreaming of vodka. Da.
CRADDOCK: You were sleepwalking near the library where the Senator was murdered?
SERGEI: Coincidence! Very unfortunate coincidence.
PENELOPE: (to roses) It was no coincidence, was it roses? He was carrying a folder.
SERGEI: (glaring at her) Zat crazy gardener should focus on gardening!
PENELOPE: (turning to them) The roses show their gratitude and admiration for me by telling me things. And they say you're full of shit ... I mean ... fertilizer.
SERGEI: Impudent woman.
CRADDOCK: What was in the folder, Mr. Volkov?
SERGEI: Cultural exchange documents. Information about ballet performances. Stravinsky ...
FINCH: (suddenly interested) The Firebird? Magnificent. That ballet captures the essence of the bird. (he moves his “wings”)
CRADDOCK: (muttering) He even knows about birds in ballet.
HARRIS: He knows about birds in everything, and it’s amazing how useful it is. ... Mr Volkov, you were discussing ballet at 1 am?
SERGEI: Night is best time to review dance arrangements. Very quiet. Good concentration.
HARRIS: Did you see the Senator?
SERGEI: (pause) Yes. He was in library. We... spoke briefly about politics. He was... how do you say... belligerent.
CRADDOCK: Was he threatening you?
SERGEI: Senator Stone threatened everyone. It was his hobby.
PENELOPE: (to plants) He collected enemies.
CRADDOCK: Did he threaten both of you last night?
PENELOPE: It went like this ... I was tending my ficus ...
SERGEI: What do you mean... cultural attaché crimes? What evidence?
STONE: Espionage and more. I shall expose it at breakfast with the Ambassador.
SERGEI: You accuse me of espionage. Ridiculous! I am cultural attaché! I attach culture! Lies! All lies!
STONE: And what’s more I have evidence of misappropriation of funds.
SERGEI: What funds?
STONE: Our government funded the new production of The Firebird at the Bolshoi.
SERGEI: Er ... yes ... very generous.
STONE: That production never happened. Where is the money?
SERGEI: It will be produced next year. We had technical troubles.
STONE: Technical troubles my ass. That money is in your pocket!
SERGEI: Vat are you saying? Zat is preposterous. You have not heard the end of this.
STONE: Get out of my library!
SERGEI: I go. I return to my Tolstoy. I need true cultural stimulation, not your American bullshit.
STONE: And you! Worthless gardener.
PENELOPE: How dare you? Flowers offer a wide range of benefits that impact physical health, emotional well-being, and the environment! I am held in very high esteem for my rose garden at the White House.
STONE: Humbug! I am cutting your budget. Totally. Get rid of that green mess!
PENELOPE: Green mess! You have not heard the end of this Senator!
STONE: Rubbish!
PENELOPE: I will reach out to higher authorities. To the vice president!
STONE: That fool!
PENELOPE: He at least is a nature lover. I will protect my garden with all my strength. You will get to my roses over my dead body!
STONE: Out!
PENELOPE: That was one-forty-five. He was very much alive.
SERGEI: Very loudly alive, shouting about rubbish. I returned to Tolstoy: true culture. Ze Russian culture, so much more genuine than your American artificial intelligence!
PENELOPE: I agree. Tolstoy was a true lover of nature. He saw nature as a realm of both ceaseless struggle and supreme harmony: War and Peace.
CRADDOCK: And where did you go, Ms Ashworth?
PENELOPE: I returned to the terrace. By the way, the roses said someone else visited the Senator after we left.
EVERYONE: (turning to her) What?
PENELOPE: Around two. I was still on the terrace. I heard voices in the library. Angry voices.
CRADDOCK: Could you identify them?
PENELOPE: (shaking head) The jasmine was blooming loudly. Very distracting. But one was the Senator. The other was... a woman.
HARRIS: You're sure?
PENELOPE: The plants are sure. I merely translate.
FINCH: Fascinating. Ms. Ashworth, you're like a Hermit Thrush. Solitary, observant, with exceptional hearing.
PENELOPE: (pleased) Thrushes are good for gardens. They eat many pests.
SERGEI: Detective, I must insist—I did not kill Senator. Yes, he threatened me. But I am diplomat! We use words as weapons, not violence!
FINCH: You had motive and opportunity. You'll need to surrender your passport.
SERGEI: (dramatically) This is international scandal! Ambassador will hear of this!
FINCH: The Ambassador already knows. No one leaves until we solve this murder.

SCENE SEVEN – THE SOMMELIER AND THE BUTLER
FINCH: (looks around disappointed through binoculars) No birds here, only a few bats.... although their habits are very interesting too.
HARRIS: So Mr Pemberton, what about last night?
FRANÇOIS: (interrupting) The Senator, he was drinking the '82 Bordeaux last night. Magnifique vintage. Wasted on his unrefined palate!
HARRIS: We'll get to you in a moment, Mr. Beaumont.
FRANÇOIS: (offended) I am sommelier! Not mister! (theatrically) I am artist of the vine!
CRADDOCK: Your movements last night, please, Mr Pemberton.
PEMBERTON: I had many duties to perform. The Senator called me. (dislike in his voice.)
HARRIS: Perhaps you had good reason to dislike Senator Stone.
PEMBERTON: So did many ...
FRANÇOIS: This is a superb wine. '82 Bordeaux – so suitable for a man of your culture and standing.
STONE: Cut out the bla bla bla François, just slosh it in.
FRANÇOIS: Senator! You insult our glorious French tradition!
STONE: Who is it?
PEMBERTON: (off) You sent for me, Sir.
STONE: Come in.
PEMBERTON: You called?
STONE: What an honour. The Indian Prince. The Maharaja Prince Ajubi.
PEMBERTON: What! I’m an Englishman.
STONE: Years of whitening cream, best private schools in England. Then a disgusting, dissolute life. Disgraced and kicked out by your family.
PEMBERTON: (shouting) It’s not true!
STONE: I have the evidence.
PEMBERTON: We all have a past – so do you, Senator.
STONE: What?
PEMBERTON: (shouting) You are a goddamn racist. And I can prove it.
STONE: (shouting) Out! And don’t show your face in my circles again.
FRANÇOIS: I was here and I heard angry voices. There was the Senator, certainement. His voice, very loud. Like cheap champagne. ... The other was Pemberton. They were shouting ... fighting.
PEMBERTON: (angrily) There was no fight! The Frenchman is lying!
FRANÇOIS: (offended) I never lie! Except about vintage years, but that is ... professional courtesy!
HARRIS: Mr Pemberton, the truth.
PEMBERTON: (reluctantly) The Senator called for me at 12.45. And he was ALIVE when I left! Drunk but alive!
HARRIS: Mr. Beaumont, why were you here at that time?
FRANÇOIS: The Bordeaux, she was not at proper temperature. I stayed until three, adjusting the wine, she is delicate! Like beautiful woman! She needs attention! (caressing a bottle)
HARRIS: Can anyone verify this?
FRANÇOIS: The wine bottles! They are witnesses!
CRADDOCK: I’ll check the cellar logs.
HARRIS: Good thinking Craddock! Check the temperature controls.
FRANÇOIS: (proudly) You will see! François never abandons his wine!
FINCH: We’ll check this later. Time for that twittering Secretary Bird.
PEMBERTON: (angrily) You filthy liar!
FRANÇOIS: It is you mon ami, the liar. I was not here, but in the library, behind the curtain. I know who you really are.
PEMBERTON: (shocked) What?
FRANÇOIS: (mimicking the Senator) The Maharaja Prince Ajubi. Whitening cream, best private schools in England. Then ... pretty girls, illicit sex ... disgraced and kicked out by your family – look at you – a humble butler.
PEMBERTON: You keep your dirty mouth shut!
FRANÇOIS: Bien sure ... with a little donation from you.
PEMBERTON: (horrified) Blackmail!
FRANÇOIS: Let’s call it white mail ... (he reaches out his hand, smiling evilly – blackout)

SCENE 8: THE AMBITIOUS ASSISTANT
FINCH: Ms. Valentine.
LUCY: (not looking up) Can we make this quick? I'm managing a crisis. Dead senators are trending on Twitter.
FINCH: You found that out fast. Like a good Secretary Bird.
LUCY: (finally looking up) I'm not a secretary. I’m the Ambassador's assistant. Information is my job.
ROSIE: She's always on her phone. I've heard her taking calls, even secretly, in the bathroom.
LUCY: (irritated) The maid. How helpful.
ROSIE: (sweetly) I aim to please.
CRADDOCK: Ms. Valentine, what did the Senator want last night?
LUCY: (sighing) What he always wanted. Information. He was investigating the Ambassador.
HARRIS: For what?
LUCY: well ... let’s say budget irregularities.
CRADDOCK: Did he expect you to provide evidence?
LUCY: (coolly) I'm loyal to Ambassador Wellington. She gave me this position.
ROSIE: (dusting) She also threatened to fire you last week.
LUCY: (whipping around) You were listening at the door!
ROSIE: (innocently) These rooms have excellent acoustics.
LUCY: (uncomfortable) It was a minor disagreement...
ROSIE: She accused her of leaking information to the press. Nepotism. The Ambassador gave her nephew the new security contract which Gerry can't manage.
GERRY: (entering, offended) I heard my name! I manage security just fine!
HARRIS: Ms Thornton, we'll speak with you later.
GERRY: Who cares! I’m preparing for my X Factor auditions! Very soon, sooner than you think, I’ll leave this crappy job and find fame! Hah!
CRADDOCK. (Sarcastic). Can’t wait to see you in action.
GERRY: Really? Here’s a taste [GERRY sings a line]
CRADDOCK: I wasn’t serious, leave us please.
FINCH: Ms. Valentine, did you leak that information?
LUCY: (pause) The Senator promised me a top position on his staff! And then he died and ruined everything!
CRADDOCK: When did you last see him?
LUCY: After dinner. He said he had new information. He wanted to meet later to discuss it. But I didn’t go: I was done being his informant!
ROSIE: (casually) I saw her leave her room at one-thirty.
LUCY: (furious) Do you watch EVERYONE?
ROSIE: (shrugging) It’s my little hobby.
LUCY: (trapped) I was going to the... kitchen. I wanted tea.
ROSIE: The kitchen is in the west wing. You were going east... to the library.
LUCY: (furious, quietly) Shut up, bitch!
HARRIS: (leaning forward) Did you meet Senator Stone at one-thirty?
LUCY: (breaking) Yes! Yes. He texted me. He had information about the Ambassador.
HARRIS: What information?
LUCY: I don't know! We argued. He wanted me to steal documents from the Ambassador. I refused. I left at two-fifteen. And he was ALIVE. Drunk and angry, but alive.
ROSIE: (to Harris) That’s true. I saw her return to her room at two-twenty.
LUCY: (to Rosie) You're creepy. You know that, right?
ROSIE: I prefer "observant."
CRADDOCK: (making notes) So Pemberton at 12.45, Volkov at one and probably Lucy around two ...
FINCH: (to Lucy) You remind me of a Starling. Intelligent. Adaptable. And thieving.
LUCY: I'm not a thief!
FINCH: Yet you were stealing information for the Senator.
LUCY: That's different! That's politics!
CRADDOCK: Is he aware that calling women “thieves” isn’t exactly cool?
HARRIS: He genuinely thinks it’s a compliment. Starlings are his third favourite bird.
CRADDOCK: and the first two?
HARRIS: Finches of course, and then swallows.
CRADDOCK: How did you know that?
HARRIS: er ...It came up in conversation ...
CRADDOCK: Sure ... and do you know his favourite colour? His birthday? His ...
HARRIS: (sharply) We’re working Constable!
ROSIE: By the way, I saw the Ambassador leaving her rooms around two-thirty.
ALL POLICE: (turning sharply) What?
ROSIE: The Ambassador. She went downstairs looking very agitated.
FINCH: Why didn't you mention this earlier?
ROSIE: (simply) You didn't ask. Also, I wanted to save it for dramatic effect.
FINCH: Ms. Cheek, you're like a Magpie. Clever. Mischievous. And hoarding information like shiny objects.
ROSIE: (pleased) Magpies are very intelligent! Thank you!
FINCH: It wasn't a compliment. We need to speak with the Ambassador immediately.

SCENE 9: THE AMBASSADOR'S SECRET
WELLINGTON: Detective, detective Finch!
FINCH: Just a moment, quiet! It’s a superb lark, wonderful song, shhh!
WELLINGTON: Have you made progress? The Australian Prime Minister has to return to Canberra. The Russian attaché is making complaints. And TV crews are outside!
FINCH: Damn them, they’ll disturb the birds. Go ahead Henriette.
HARRIS: My name is Harriet. Ambassador, you were seen leaving your rooms at two-thirty.
WELLINGTON: (sitting heavily) I couldn't sleep. I had indigestion and Senator Stone was... difficult. I went to the library to talk to the Senator.
WELLINGTON: Senator Stone, you’ve been making accusations. Threatening to reveal... things.
STONE: What ... things?
WELLINGTON: (long pause) I know I made mistakes years ago. Budget allocation decisions that could be... misinterpreted.
STONE: Ambassador, look at these documents. Evidence of corruption is clear.
WELLINGTON: (sharply) This could end my career!
STONE: Exactly! Laughing drunkenly
WELLINGTON: Senator, if these financial records are taken out of context, they are damning!
STONE: I will release them to the press unless you resign.
WELLINGTON: Go to hell. I'll weather whatever scandal you create. I've been in politics years longer than you and I know how to survive.
STONE: laughing more You’ll be finished by Monday.
WELLINGTON: I’ll make sure you keep your mouth shut. She leaves furiously.
PEMBERTON: Ambassador, you should consult a lawyer.
WELLINGTON: Why? I’ve done nothing!
HARRIS: What time did you leave the Senator?
WELLINGTON: Three o’clock.
PEMBERTON: I can verify that. I heard her return. I was awake due to the... noise from the Prime Minister's rooms.
CRADDOCK: (making notes) So the Ambassador returned at three. The Senator was alive, and by 6.47, he was dead.
WELLINGTON: (desperately) Alright, I hated him! He was destroying my career! But I didn't murder him!
FINCH: You're like a Red-tailed Hawk. Powerful. Territorial. And deadly when threatened.
WELLINGTON: (coldly) If you plan to arrest me, Detective, do it now. Otherwise, I have a crisis to manage.
FINCH: No arrest. Yet. But don't leave the grounds.
HARRIS: My name is Harriet.
CRADDOCK: He doesn’t even know your name!
HARRIS: Why should he?
CRADDOCK: Look at him, typical man! A one-track mind, incapable of multi-tasking.
HARRIS: Not true. He's unconventional, and his methods work.
CRADDOCK: You really admire him, don't you?
HARRIS: (quickly) Professionally. I admire him professionally.
PEMBERTON: Detective, detective! (Finch, annoyed, turns) I have some something to say.
FINCH: Go on.
PEMBERTON: The Senator carried a red folder everywhere. I believe it contained evidence against the other guests. It was his power.
CRADDOCK: Where is the folder now?
PEMBERTON: That's the strange thing. It wasn't in the library.
CRADDOCK: So the killer took it ... or someone else after the murder.
HARRIS: Who else had access to the library?
PEMBERTON: Everyone. It's not locked.
CRADDOCK: Did you hear anything unusual after 3?
PEMBERTON: (considering) I heard loud footsteps. Around 4. Heavy boots.
CRADDOCK: Boots at four?
PEMBERTON: The gardener starts then. And the security patrol changes at four.
HARRIS: Gerry said she was on duty all night.
PEMBERTON: (coldly) Hah! I know the truth about Gerry ... and about everyone. I am the only one who knows all the secrets!
BLAKE: Listen! They need me in Canberra! I can’t ...
SERGEI: Vere is ze Vodka?
WELLINGTON: Are you making progress?
FRANCOIS: My Bordeaux – she is vanished!
PENELOPE: My insecticide has been stolen.
LUCY: Ambassador, an urgent call for you.
MAGGIE: Lunch is waiting to be served.
ROSIE: Pemberton, we need you.

ACT TWO
SCENE 1: THE POISONING
CRADDOCK: Is he dead?
PENELOPE: (checking pulse) No. Unconscious. Call an ambulance!
HARRIS: (on phone) Ambulance to Raven Hall.
PENELOPE: His breathing's shallow but steady... Symptoms of poisoning! - my insecticide. I told you it was stolen!
FINCH: (sniffing the glass) Organophosphate. Not enough to kill, but enough to incapacitate.
WELLINGTON: Someone tried to silence him!
PEMBERTON: (groaning, coming to) The... folder... the Senator's folder...
PENELOPE: Don't speak. Save your strength.
PEMBERTON: (weakly) I know... who took it... I saw them... at four-thirty...
ROSIE: Who? Who did you see?
PEMBERTON: (losing consciousness again) The... the... [He passes out.]
HARRIS: Get him to hospital. We need a guard on his room.
CRADDOCK: I'll go with him. [They exit with Pemberton. Blackout.]

SCENE 2: THE INVESTIGATION INTENSIFIES
CRADDOCK: I’m pleased to say Pemberton has recovered. It was a powerful insecticide.
FINCH: But we must face the facts. One of you tried to murder him.
ALL: One of us!
FINCH: For now, you are all suspects: murder and attempted murder.
WELLINGTON: This is outrageous!
SERGEI: I demand diplomatic immunity!
BLAKE: Me too, for that matter.
LUCY: I'm calling my lawyer!
FRANÇOIS: (enters suddenly) My wine! Someone stole my precious Bordeaux! Ten crates of it.
FINCH: (loudly) QUIET! (silence) Thank you. Now, like a parliament of owls, we must observe and listen.
GERRY: (raising hand) Detective, I have information.
ALL: (turning) Information?
GERRY: I wasn't exactly... monitoring the cameras all night.
WELLINGTON: We know. You were watching X Factor.
GERRY: Not just that. I was... rehearsing in the security room with headphones on.
WELLINGTON: (furious) You abandoned your post completely?
GERRY: Only from midnight to four. I have footage. I set the cameras to record.
GERRY: See? Eleven-forty-five. There's the Senator entering the library. Twelve-forty-five, Pemberton goes in, comes out at one-fifteen.
SERGEI: Then me, leaving at one-forty.
LUCY: And me going in at one-fifty five. I left at two-fifteen.
WELLINGTON: And I went in at two-thirty, left at three.
HARRIS: Who's that?
CRADDOCK: (excited) The murderer! Or the folder thief!
PENELOPE: (squinting) Those boots... I've seen those boots before!
GERRY: Wait, there's more. At five-thirty, someone else goes in.
MAGGIE: Two people?
FINCH: Perhaps one killed him, another took the folder. Like crows at carrion – multiple scavengers.
CRADDOCK: (to Harris) Did he just compare murder to bird feeding behaviour?
HARRIS: That's actually one of his more normal observations.
CRADDOCK: Three years with him. Why do you stay?
HARRIS: (glancing at Finch) Someone has to keep him alive. Last month he nearly walked into traffic watching a peregrine falcon.
CRADDOCK: And you rescued him?
HARRIS: (quietly) And I always will.
WELLINGTON: Can we see their faces?
GERRY: The hoods hide the faces ... but wait! (zooms in) There! A ring on the first person's hand!
ROSIE: (gasping) That's a diplomatic ring! Like Mr. Volkov's!
SERGEI: (hiding his hand) Many people have such rings!
CRADDOCK: May we see your hands, everyone?
MAGGIE: (suddenly) The second person! Look at their pocket! Something's sticking out!
GERRY: (zooming) A green cloth. Looks like... a gardening glove?
PENELOPE: (defensive) Half the staff uses gardening gloves!
HARRIS: But you reported yours stolen, along with the insecticide.
PENELOPE: Someone is framing me! The plants would never forgive me for murder!
ROSIE: There’s something you don’t know... I’m ashamed to tell you about it.
WELLINGTON: Go on Rosie, don’t worry. The Police have to know all the details.

SCENE 3: FLASHBACK - THE SENATOR AND ROSIE
ROSIE: Your towels, Senator. (sets them down, turns to leave)
STONE: Wait. You're the maid, aren't you? Rosie?
ROSIE: Yes, sir. Will that be all?
STONE: (standing, moving closer) Pretty thing. Always around, always watching.
ROSIE: (stepping back) I should go, sir.
STONE: (advancing) I bet you see everything in this house. Hear everything.
ROSIE: (stepping back) Senator, please...
STONE: (leering) We could make an arrangement. Tell me what you know... I make it worthwhile. In the meantime, how about a little something for me!
ROSIE: (furious) How dare you! I may be a maid but I'm not for sale!
STONE: (rubbing his face, angry) You bitch!
ROSIE: Touch me again and I'll report you for harassment! I have witnesses! I'll ruin you!
STONE: (laughing cruelly) Report me? Who'd believe a maid?
ROSIE: Try me. (storms out)
STONE: (shouting after her) You'll regret this!

SCENE 4: BACK TO PRESENT - ROSIE'S REVELATION
ROSIE: (quietly) I should have told you earlier. The Senator... he tried to assault me.
CRADDOCK: (gently) You were right to tell us what happened. Women should never put up with that.
MAGGIE: That bastard.
BLAKE: Geez. That’s tough, Rosie.
ROSIE: I was terrified he'd get me fired. Or worse. So I said nothing.
HARRIS: Did you see him again that night?
ROSIE: No! I locked myself in my room after that!
FINCH: You're like a Wren. You appear vulnerable... but you are fierce when defending your territory.
ROSIE: (wiping eyes) Thank you ... I think.
LUCY: Rosie, I'm so sorry. If I'd known... I wouldn’t have been so ...um... bitchy with you.
ROSIE: It’s all right Lucy. I guess I had a bad attitude with you too.
LUCY: Hey, let’s go out for a drink together. A glass of prosecco might clear the air!
ROSIE: Sure!
LUCY: Anyway it explains why you were hanging round such a lot.
ROSIE: Yeah, I was watching everyone. I wanted dirt on the bastard.
LUCY: Did you get it?
ROSIE: Some. I saw François in the cellar, talking on the phone about getting free wine for the Senator.
FRANÇOIS: Qu'est-ce que tu racontes?
WELLINGTON: Procuring wine for the Senator?
ROSIE: The Senator found out he was selling our wine to a restaurant.
FRANÇOIS: (sputtering) Zat is... zat is... (deflates) Oui. It is true. Zis is what ‘appened.
FRANÇOIS: This is a superb wine. '82 Bordeaux – so suitable for a man of your culture and standing.
STONE: Cut out the bla bla bla François, just slosh it in.
FRANÇOIS: Mais oui. Here you are.
STONE: By the way, I was having dinner at the Tower Restaurant ...
FRANÇOIS: ... oh, er ... (cough) 3 Michelin stars! Excellent food.
STONE: The food and the wine.
FRANÇOIS: ze vine, yes...
STONE: '82 Bordeaux ... with a small note on the label: produced for Raven Hall.... how do you explain that?
FRANÇOIS: (very dramatically) Sacre bleu! I have been discovered! It will be the end for me. Please, please, I beg you, do not tell the Ambassador. I am a dead man.
STONE: We can arrange something. Like a steady supply of superb wine for me.
FRANÇOIS: Je vous remercie beaucoup, beaucoup! Another glass of wine, Senator. (he fills his glass)
FRANÇOIS: It was like that ...
ROSIE: Hmm, I knew it.
HARRIS: Would you care to share some more information, Rosie?
ROSIE: Absolutely! I heard Gerry on the phone with a magazine, selling stories about the Ambassador.
GERRY: (caught) I need money for my music career!
WELLINGTON: You're both fired.
HARRIS: Deal with that after the investigation, Ambassador. Now, Rosie, did you see the red folder?
ROSIE: The Senator carried it everywhere. He had it at dinner.... er ... There’s something else ... I did something dishonest, something a maid should never do. I looked inside the folder. I saw notes about everyone. Incriminating notes!

SCENE 5: THE BLACKMAIL DEEPENS
FRANÇOIS: Ah, Pemberton. Or should I say... Prince Ajubi?
PEMBERTON: (coldly) What do you want?
FRANÇOIS: Your secret is safe... for a price. Ten thousand dollars.
PEMBERTON: You're a coward, and a criminal, blackmailing me.
FRANÇOIS : Je préfère "financial arrangement." Bien, the Senator had evidence. I heard everything. Now he's dead... but I remember.
PEMBERTON: You're despicable.
FRANÇOIS: (shrugging) I am French. We are practical about such things.
PEMBERTON: And if I refuse?
FRANÇOIS: Then everyone learns about the disgraced Prince who became a butler. (pauses) And about the reason you were disgraced.
PEMBERTON: (grabbing him) You wouldn't dare!
FRANÇOIS: (smugly) Try me, mon ami.
FINCH: Blackmail is illegal, Mr. Beaumont. Blackbirds are clever thieves, but they always get caught.
FRANÇOIS: (startled) I... it was a joke! A jest!
HARRIS: We have it recorded. You're under arrest for attempted blackmail.
FRANÇOIS: Non! Non! I was trying to help solve the murder! I thought if I scared him, he would confess!
PEMBERTON: Liar!
FINCH: Take him away, Hannah.
HARRIS: Harriet.
FRANCOIS: Non- je suis innocent! je n'ai rien fait de mal. Non !!!
FINCH: Mr. Pemberton, any idea who might have poisoned you?
PEMBERTON: I saw someone at four-thirty after I left the Ambassador. I went to the kitchen for water. Someone was in the hallway, carrying the red folder.
FINCH: Who?
PEMBERTON: I couldn't see. They wore a hood. But I recognized something... a perfume. Expensive. French.
FINCH: Ambassador Wellington wears French perfume.
PEMBERTON: So does Lucy. And even Rosie, probably pinched from the Ambassador!
FINCH: More thieving magpies!

SCENE 6: THE ROMANTIC INTERLUDE
BLAKE: Hiding from the chaos?
MAGGIE: (not looking up) Thinking.
BLAKE: About us?
MAGGIE: (turning) There is no us, Prime Minister. Last night was... a mistake.
BLAKE: Didn't feel like a mistake. It felt rather spectacular.
MAGGIE: (smiling despite herself) Stop that.
BLAKE: Stop what?
MAGGIE: Being charming. It's infuriating.
BLAKE: (moving closer) I can't help it. It's the Australian way. (pause) Maggie, I meant what I said last night.
MAGGIE: You were drunk.
BLAKE: I was honest. You're remarkable. Strong, talented, passionate...
MAGGIE: Irish, working-class, completely wrong for a Prime Minister.
BLAKE: (taking her hand) Bugger that. When I'm near you, I feel alive.
MAGGIE: (wavering) Blake...
BLAKE: Give us a chance. After this nightmare ends. Dinner in Sydney? I know a place with the best seafood.
MAGGIE: You're serious?
BLAKE: Serious as a heart attack. (pause) Too soon?
MAGGIE: (laughing) Terrible timing. But... yes. After this is over. Dinner would be lovely. And the rest!
CRADDOCK: Sorry to interrupt, but Detective Finch needs everyone in the drawing room. Now.

SCENE 7: THE GATHERING
CRADDOCK: Where the hell is he?
HARRIS: I guess he’s found a bird.
CRADDOCK: He knows so much about birds. But it distracts him too much.
HARRIS: Just wait and see how he uses bird behaviour. Last month he used bird symbolism in Shakespeare to solve a crime, a murder in the theatre.
CRADDOCK: You’re not kidding!
HARRIS: no, it was brilliant, he linked killer birds to the lead actor in Macbeth ... shhh, here he is.
FINCH: (enters) Sorry I’m late! Just had to catch a Barn Owl. Quite a rare specimen. Thank you all for coming. (pause) I believe I know who killed Senator Stone.
WELLINGTON: Finally!
FINCH: But first, let me explain my method. You see, birds reveal truth through behaviour. Migration patterns, mating rituals, territorial disputes... all mirror human nature.
LUCY: This is insane.
FINCH: Is it? Consider: The Senator was like a Vulture. Aggressive, territorial, using secrets to weapons. He threatened everyone here.
SERGEI: This is true.
FINCH: Sergei Volkov - you're a Raven. Intelligent, opportunistic. The Senator accused you of embezzling the money for the Firebird ballet. You had motive.
SERGEI: I did not kill him!
FINCH: No. Because Ravens are patient. You would have defeated him politically, not murdered him.
SERGEI: And I would have done so!
FINCH: Ambassador Wellington - a Red-tailed Hawk. Powerful, protective of territory. He threatened your career.
WELLINGTON: I already told you—
FINCH: You visited him at two-thirty. Argued. Left at three. But here's what's interesting: Hawks are diurnal. They don't hunt at dawn.
WELLINGTON: What does that mean?
FINCH: You're not a morning person, Ambassador. You never wake before eight. Yet the murder occurred between four and six am.
LUCY: (nervous) What about me?
FINCH: Lucy Valentine - a Starling. Adaptable, clever, thriving in chaos. You were feeding him information. He betrayed you.
LUCY: I didn't kill him!
FINCH: No. Because Starlings are survivors. You'd simply find a new patron.
HARRIS: Which you did - you're already negotiating with a rival senator.
LUCY: (shocked) How did you—
HARRIS: Your phone records. Simple.
FINCH: Now, Penelope Ashworth - a Hermit Thrush. Solitary, observant. You heard arguing. Reported seeing someone at two am.
PENELOPE: The plants never lie!
FINCH: No, but humans do. You said you were on the terrace until two. But the security footage shows the terrace was empty after midnight.
PENELOPE: (flustered) I... the jasmine... I was confused about timing!
FINCH: Or you were in the library. You argued with the Senator about budget cuts. He was destroying your garden - your life's work.
PENELOPE: (crying) He called it a "green mess"! Thirty years of cultivation!
FINCH: But you didn't kill him either. Because you're not a killer - you're a nurturer.
WELLINGTON: Then who, Detective?
FINCH: We can set aside the Prime Minister. He has a pretty firm alibi, so to speak, our Peacock.
BLAKE: Bloody hell, I’m glad of that night’s negotiations with Maggie ... for more reasons than one!
MAGGIE: Ambassador, you won’t fire me for that little indiscretion, will you?
WELLINGTON: when I was your age my dear, I did much worse! Or better! (they laugh a little)
FINCH: Let me tell you about one more bird. The Cuckoo. It lays eggs in other birds' nests. A parasite. A deceiver.
FINCH: Someone here has been playing multiple roles. Deceiving everyone. Like a Cuckoo.
PENELOPE: Like the swallows’ nest I found in my geraniums. The cuckoo had taken possession of it.
FINCH: Gerry Thornton. You claim you were rehearsing during the critical hours. But you're lying.
GERRY: (standing) What? No! I showed you the footage!
HARRIS: Footage you could have edited. You're the security chief. You control the cameras.
GERRY: That's ridiculous!
HARRIS: Is it? You needed money desperately for your music career. The Senator was wealthy. You asked him for money, with threats, or possibly promises ...of sexual favours?
GERRY: (backing away) I would never—
CRADDOCK: But he laughed at you. Called your singing "caterwauling." It's in his diary, which we found in the folder.
HARRIS: The folder that disappeared.
CRADDOCK: The folder you took, Gerry. After you killed him. You wore Penelope's stolen coat and gloves.
PENELOPE: So, you were framing me! What have I ever done to harm you? You, you repel me like ... like a bunch of supermarket flowers!
CRADDOCK: (interrupting) Shall we leave that till later, Penelope?
HARRIS: You knew about the cameras, so you hid your face. But you forgot one thing.
GERRY: What?
CRADDOCK: Your boots. The same boots visible in the footage. We checked.
GERRY: (desperate) You can't prove anything!
HARRIS: We found your finger prints on the letter opener. (showing it to her)
GERRY: (breaking down) He ruined everything. I begged him for a loan, just five thousand dollars! He laughed. Said I'd never make it ... said I was talentless! And then ... it’s true, I offered to sleep with him ... and he said he’d rather sleep with a cow.
ROSIE: Oh, poor Gerry.
GERRY: I didn't plan to kill him! I went to take the folder, to find dirt on him for revenge! But he woke up, called me pathetic! Said I was wasting my life! So I... I grabbed the letter opener and...
CRADDOCK: Geraldine Thornton, you're under arrest for the murder of Senator Harvey Stone.
GERRY: I could have been famous! He destroyed my dream!
FINCH: No, Ms. Thornton. You destroyed it yourself. Like a Cuckoo that kills its nest-mates. True talent doesn't need murder. It needs patience.
CRADDOCK: You have the right to remain silent, but whatever you say may be used against you in a court of law.
FINCH: By the way, Craddock, well done. You’re a Crow, as I said, one of the most intelligent birds.
CRADDOCK: Thanks! I’ve learnt a lot from you, boss. (to Harris) And you too, Harriet. (Harris looks very happy)
HARRIS: Great job for your first time out. I hope we can work together again.
CRADDOCK: (quietly to Harris) You know, Finch is actually not bad. Weird, but not bad.
HARRIS: (softly) No. Not bad at all.
CRADDOCK: You should tell him how you feel.
HARRIS: (firmly) There's nothing to tell.
CRADDOCK: (smirking) Right. And I'm a pigeon. Come on, Gerry.

SCENE 8: RESOLUTION
WELLINGTON: I still can't believe it. Gerry.
ROSIE: She always seemed so... harmless.
FINCH: That's what made her dangerous. Like a Cuckoo, she appeared innocent while plotting.
BLAKE: What about Pemberton's poisoning?
HARRIS: Gerry again. She heard him say he saw someone at four-thirty. She stole the insecticide, tried to silence him.
PEMBERTON: (touching his throat) She almost succeeded.
PENELOPE: My poor insecticide. Used for evil instead of pest control.
HARRIS: She even used the Ambassador’s perfume to put us off the scent, so to speak.
SERGEI: And the folder?
HARRIS: Hidden in Gerry's car. We recovered it. All the Senator's "evidence" against everyone.
WELLINGTON: (nervous) What will happen to it?
HARRIS: Well, the FBI will handle it.
LUCY: So we're all... exposed?
FINCH: Perhaps. But let’s keep it quiet. What happens in Raven Hall stays in Raven Hall, right?
PENELOPE: But only Gerry chose murder.
ROSIE: Lucy I’ve got a little confession – but it’s top secret!
LUCY: Trust me!
ROSIE: I didn’t tell the whole truth about Senator Stone ... we were having an affair!
LUCY: Oooh Rosie, you naughty girl!
ROSIE: He was kind to me, lovely presents ... I never loved him, but we had fun together.
LUCY: Some time I’ll tell you my secrets!
BLAKE: Well. I’d better get moving. (standing) Maggie, help me pack? I leave tomorrow.
MAGGIE: (smiling) About that dinner in Sydney...
BLAKE: (grinning) I'll send my private jet.
WELLINGTON: A Prime Minister and my chef. Wonderful.
PENELOPE: (cheerfully) At least something good came from this mess!
SERGEI: (bringing Penelope forward while the others continue drinking behind). Perhaps something else good: a word, Miss Penelope.
PENELOPE: yes, Mr Volkov?
SERGEI: I have been observing you and your love for nature. You know our great writers – Tolstoy, Chekhov, Turgenev – adored nature.
PENELOPE: oh, yes, I devour many of your brilliant writers, especially Tolstoy.
SERGEI: Really? You know Tolstoy had a beautiful Dacha not far from Moscow?
PENELOPE: His country paradise! yes, of course!
SERGEI: I have one too. And it needs a real gardener, the land is – what is it – savage?
PENELOPE: Wild.
SERGEI: yes, wild – Miss Penelope, would you join me there, and tame my wild garden?
PENELOPE: Really? I’d be honoured, Mr Volkov.
SERGEI: Oh, please call me Sergei.
PENELOPE: My best friends call me Penny.
SERGEI: Penny ... in return I’ll teach you to dance. The real spirit of my mother country: Kalinka!
PENELOPE: Who would believe there’d been a tragedy here!
PEMBERTON: Indeed. And Ambassador, about my ... background.
WELLINGTON: Your secret is safe, Pemberton. We all have pasts. You're the best butler I've ever had. That's what matters.
PEMBERTON: (bowing) Thank you, ma'am.
FINCH: I should go. Paperwork awaits. But first... (looking through audience with binoculars) Ah! A Cardinal! Beautiful red plumage! They mate for life, you know. Loyal until death.
PENELOPE: (laughing) We know, Detective! (they all laugh)
FINCH: (lowering binoculars, smiling) Yes. Well. Remember: we're all birds in a way. Some predatory, some timid, some deceptive. The key is understanding which bird you are... and acting accordingly.
CRADDOCK: (to Harris) He’s so observant about birds, yet he's completely blind about people.
HARRIS: (watching Finch go) What do you mean?
CRADDOCK: Oh, come on. You look at him like he's the last chocolate in the box.
HARRIS: (flustered) I do not!
ROSIE: (overhearing) You absolutely do. I noticed.
HARRIS: (embarrassed) This is completely inappropriate. We're professionals.
LUCY: Life's short, Harriet. You should tell him.
HARRIS: He doesn't see me that way. He told me I am ... a Dove. Patient. Loyal.
CRADDOCK: Exactly. You know what birds mate for life?
HARRIS: (suspicious) What?
CRADDOCK: (pulling out phone, reading) Doves. I just googled it. "Doves are symbols of lifelong partnership."
HARRIS: (torn between hope and scepticism) He didn't mean it like that.
SERGEI: In Russia, we have saying: "The blind man cannot see the stars, even when they shine for him."
PENELOPE: The roses say you should take a chance.
HARRIS: (looking at them all) You're all ridiculous.
SERGEI: Perhaps. But we're not wrong. Take your chance.
HARRIS: (standing, flustered) I need to... file paperwork. Excuse me.
SERGEI: So. Is strange ending, da?
LUCY: Strange beginning. Strange middle. Strange end.
ROSIE: At least the real villain is caught. And I don't have to clean up any more murder scenes!
WELLINGTON: Until next time.
ALL: (turning to her in horror) NEXT TIME?!
WELLINGTON: (smiling wickedly) Joking. Mostly.
PEMBERTON: (to audience) And thus concludes another chaotic evening at Raven Hall. Where secrets lurk, birds watch, and murder... occasionally interrupts dinner.
ALL: (raising glasses) To survival!
